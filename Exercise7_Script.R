#Write R code that will convert the comma-delimited
#iris.csv file to a tab-delimited version names 
#iris.txt

#Provide R code that creates a list of length 5. 
#The list should contain the following elements: 
# 1) a vector with length 10 containing 100, 200, . . . , 1000; 
# 2) a two-row, two-column data frame with the team names and final score from 
#    last weekâ€™s Notre Dame football game, 
# 3) the number 999, 
# 4) a 10-row, 5-column matrix containing integers from 1 to 50, and 
# 5) a vector containing three letters.
