# set work directory and read data frame 
setwd("C:\\Users\\debit\\Downloads\\Stem decay project")
iris <- read.csv("iris.csv")

# Question 1: Write R code that will convert the comma-delimited iris.csv file to a tab-delimited 
version names iris.txt

# write a txt file from csv file
write.table(iris,"iris.txt",row.names=FALSE,sep="\t")

#Question 2. Provide R code that creates a list of length 5. The list should contain the following 
elements: 1) a vector with length 10 conatining 100,200,....1000; 2) a two-row, two-column data 
frame with the team names and final score from last week's Notre Dame football game, 3) the number 
999, 4) a 10-row, 5-column matrix containing integers from 1 to 50, and 5) a vector containing 
three letters

#1) a vector with length 10 conatining 100,200,....1000
vectorNum <- c(100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000)

#2) a two-row, two-column data frame with the team names and final score from last week's Notre Dame 
football game
score <- c(7,58)
colnames <- c(Pittsburg","Notre Dame")
team <- matrix(data=c(colnames, score), nrow=2, ncol=2)

# 3) the number 999
number <- 999

# 4) a 10-row, 5-column matrix containing integers from 1 to 50
mat <- matrix(data=1:50, nrow=10, ncol =5)

# 5) a vector containing three letters
vectorLet <- c("a","b","c")

# list 1,2,3,4,5 in a dataframe 
mylist <- list (
  Vec1= vectorNum,
  Team = team, 
  Number = number,
  matrix = mat, 
  Vec2 = vectorLet
  
)
mylist

# length of mylist 
length(mylist)
